      <p>
        I've been in the software industry professionally since 2015 and a
        website tinkerer since 1997. I made a bunch of geocities websites back
        in the day for gaming groups and have had an interest in how UI/UX
        affects our experience with the internet since then.
      </p>
      <p>
        I live in the Bay Area with my lovely wife, two amazing kids, and two
        loveable dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm an avid gamer, including video games and table top games like D&D.
